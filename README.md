# 🎓 EduBridge: Academia–Industry Collaboration Platform
### Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2026) — Problem Statement ID 26044
**"Portal for Academia - Industry Collaboration for Skill Mapping, Internships and Placement"**

---

## 🌟 Overview
**EduBridge** is a full-stack, enterprise-grade Academia–Industry collaboration platform built for Indian technical universities and engineering institutions. It solves the critical disconnect between university curricula, student skill development, and industry hiring standards through:
1. **Explainable, Deterministic Multi-Dimensional Matching Engine** (70% Skill Overlap + 20% Branch Alignment + 10% Academic Eligibility).
2. **Multi-Branch Standardized Skill Taxonomy & Scenario Assessments** covering 6 major engineering departments (CSE, IT, ENTC, Mechanical, Civil, Electrical) and 11 specialized branches.
3. **Career Track Benchmarking & Actionable Learning Roadmaps** providing clear skill gap visualization (Recharts Radar & Comparative Deltas).
4. **Institutional Curriculum Gap Radar** aggregating real-time corporate requisition requirements against student assessment scores to signal policy actions for Board of Studies and Faculty Development Programs (FDPs).
5. **Verifiable Digital Student Portfolio & Printable Credential Slugs** with institution verification seals.

## ⚙️ Mathematical Matching Engine Formula
Rather than opaque black-box scoring, the matching engine computes deterministic, explainable compatibility:

$$\text{Composite Match Score} = 0.70 \times \text{SkillMatch} + 0.20 \times \text{BranchMatch} + 0.10 \times \text{CgpaEligibility}$$

Where:
- $\text{SkillMatch} = \frac{\sum_{i} \min(S_i, R_i) \times W_i}{\sum_{i} (R_i \times W_i)} \times 100$
- $\text{BranchMatch} = 100\%$ if student's branch is in posting's eligible list, else $0\%$
- $\text{CgpaEligibility} = 100\%$ if $\text{Student CGPA} \ge \text{Min CGPA}$, else scaled proportionally
