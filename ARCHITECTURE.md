*Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2026) — Problem Statement PS 26044*

---

## 1. System Overview

**EduBridge** is a unified, multi-stakeholder web platform designed to bridge the structural gap between engineering academia and industry requirements. In conventional educational ecosystems, curricula, student skill development, faculty industry exposure, and corporate recruitment function in isolated silos. EduBridge integrates all five key academic-industry stakeholders—**Students**, **Faculty / Academicians**, **Industry Recruiters**, **Institution / Placement Cell Administrators**, and **Alumni**—into a single, data-driven, continuous collaboration platform.

### Core Objectives & Capabilities
- **Deterministic Skill Gap Intelligence:** Standardized skill taxonomy mapped to real engineering branches and corporate career roles, calculating exact percentage deficits between student proficiency and industry benchmarks.
- **Multimodal Assessment Engine:** Evaluation via technical MCQs, aptitude tests, and automated practical source-code file submissions across Java, Python, C++, and JavaScript.
- **Transparent Mathematical Match Engine:** Multi-factor weighted recommendation algorithm (70% Skill Proficiency + 20% Academic Branch Alignment + 10% CGPA Eligibility) powering bi-directional candidate-to-opportunity matching.
- **Automated Digital Portfolio & ATS Resume Builder:** Verifiable project showcase with live public URLs (`/portfolio/:slug`), certificate storage, and dynamically generated ATS/Modern/Professional resumes compiled from platform data.
- **Continuous Industry-Academia Linkage:** Corporate internship and job requisitions, Faculty Development Programs (FDPs), industry mentorship sessions, and alumni career guidance networks.
- **Institutional Accreditation & Placement Analytics:** Real-time NAAC/NIRF Criteria 5.2.1/5.2.2 reporting, Curriculum Gap Radar analysis, tier-wise company placement statistics, and automated academic rank calculation.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Layer Interaction Flow
1. **User Interaction:** A user initiates an action in the React client (e.g., submitting an assessment, posting an internship, requesting mentorship).
2. **Client Request:** `axios` instance in `lib/api.ts` attaches the JWT token from `localStorage` into the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
3. **Route & Auth Handling:** Express router receives the request; `authenticateJwt` validates the token, queries Prisma to load the user profile context, and assigns `req.user`.
4. **Role Authorization:** `requireRoles(...)` ensures the actor possesses the requisite permissions.
5. **Payload Validation:** `validateBody(zodSchema)` guarantees strict runtime typing and rejects malformed payloads before execution.
6. **Business Logic & Math Engine:** Backend executes the operation, invoking `calculateMatchScore(...)` or rank aggregators where applicable.
7. **Database Persistence:** Prisma ORM performs atomic queries/mutations against the relational database.
8. **Structured Response:** Client receives a normalized JSON response and updates the UI state reactively.

---

## 4. Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **React 18** using **Vite 6** as the build tool and bundler.

### 4.1 Routing & Route Protection
The client routing in `frontend/src/App.tsx` utilizes `react-router-dom` v6:
- **Public Routes:** `/`, `/login`, `/register`, `/portfolio/:slug`, `/messages`.
- **Role-Guarded Routes:** Wrapped with `<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={[...]} />` which verifies `user.role` from `AuthContext` and redirects unauthorized actors to `/`.

```
/ (LandingPage)
|-- /login, /register
|-- /portfolio/:slug (Public Portfolio)
|-- /messages (Common Messaging)
|-- /student/*
|   |-- /dashboard, /profile, /assessment, /coding, /career-gaps
|   |-- /opportunities, /applications, /projects, /events, /alumni
|-- /academician/*
|   |-- /dashboard, /opportunities, /mentorship, /profile
|-- /industry/*
|   |-- /dashboard, /post, /applicants, /company-profile
|-- /admin/*
|   |-- /dashboard, /placement-stats, /curriculum-gap, /roster, /settings
|-- /alumni/*
    |-- /dashboard
```

### 4.2 State & Context Management
- **`AuthContext.tsx`:** Manages global user authentication state, active JWT tokens, session persistence via `localStorage`, login/register methods, demo account switcher (`switchDemoRole`), and dynamic profile refreshes (`refreshUserProfile`).
- **Component Local State:** Handled via standard React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`) for high responsiveness without unnecessary external state overhead.

### 4.3 UI Design System & Component Structure
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4:** Custom design palette (`slate`, `blue`, `indigo`, `emerald`, `amber`, `rose`, `violet`) with glassmorphism effects, flexbox/grid layouts, and responsive breakpoints.
- **Lucide React Icons:** Consistent iconography throughout navigation, metrics cards, status tags, and action buttons.
- **Recharts 2.15:** High-performance data visualization for:
  - Radar Charts (`RadarChart`, `PolarGrid`, `PolarAngleAxis`, `PolarRadiusAxis`, `Radar`) for student skill vs. target benchmark comparisons and institutional curriculum gap radars.
  - Bar Charts (`BarChart`, `XAxis`, `YAxis`, `Tooltip`, `Legend`, `Bar`) for department readiness scores and applicant pipeline stages.
- **`ProfilePhotoUpload.tsx`:** Unified image uploader component with client-side validation (5MB limit, JPG/PNG/WEBP), image preview, and multipart form submission.
- **`DemoSwitcherBar.tsx`:** Quick role-switching top bar allowing instant demonstration across all five user personas without re-entering credentials.
- **PDF Resume Exporter:** Built with `jspdf` and `html2canvas` for client-side rendering and downloading of ATS-compliant resumes.

---

## 5. Backend Architecture

The backend is built as a RESTful service using **Express 4** in **TypeScript (Node.js)** with modular route separation.

### 5.1 Server Entry & Middleware Pipeline
1. `src/server.ts` initializes the server, binds environment variables, and listens on `PORT` (default: 5000).
2. `src/app.ts` configures global middleware:
   - `cors({ origin: '*', credentials: true })`: Enables cross-origin requests.
   - `express.json({ limit: '15mb' })`: Parses large JSON payloads (e.g., source code submissions, resume draft JSON blobs).
   - `express.urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '15mb' })`: URL-encoded form parser.
   - `express.static(...)`: Serves uploaded avatars and certificates statically under `/uploads`.
   - Global error handler intercepting runtime exceptions.

### 5.2 API Route Modules
All endpoints are namespaced under `/api`:
- `/api/auth` (`auth.routes.ts`): User authentication, registration, profile updates, unified photo uploads, demo switcher.
- `/api/skills` (`skills.routes.ts`): Skill taxonomy, career roles, MCQ assessment, coding assessment upload, question bank CRUD.
- `/api/opportunities` (`opportunities.routes.ts`): Opportunity creation, listing, filtering, matching, updating, deleting.
- `/api/applications` (`applications.routes.ts`): Application submissions, candidate ranking, recruitment pipeline stage transitions.
- `/api/portfolio` (`portfolio.routes.ts`): Project/certificate uploads, public portfolio view, dynamic ATS resume builder.
- `/api/mentorship` (`mentorship.routes.ts`): Faculty mentorship events, workshop scheduling, registration.
- `/api/alumni` (`alumni.routes.ts`): Alumni feed, thought posts, likes/comments, 1-on-1 mentorship requests.
- `/api/analytics` (`analytics.routes.ts`): Role-specific dashboards, curriculum gap radar, company stats, NAAC reports, student roster rank calculations.
- `/api/notifications` (`notifications.routes.ts`): In-app notifications and read state management.
- `/api/messages` (`messages.routes.ts`): Direct peer-to-peer messaging between platform users.

---

## 6. Database Architecture

The persistence model is managed by **Prisma ORM** interacting with an SQLite database (`backend/prisma/schema.prisma`).

```

## 7. Authentication & Security

1. **Password Hashing:** Passwords encrypted using `bcryptjs` with salt round factor 10 prior to database write.
2. **Stateless JWT Tokens:** Standard signed JSON Web Tokens (`jsonwebtoken`) containing `{ id, email, role }` signed with `JWT_SECRET`, expiring in `7d`.
3. **Role-Based Authorization:** Strict route interceptors (`requireRoles`) ensuring students cannot access recruiter pipelines, recruiters cannot modify institutional settings, and non-administrators cannot perform moderation.
4. **Input Sanitization & Schema Validation:** Request payloads validated with `zod` schemas enforcing string length limits, allowed enum sets, and type coercion.
5. **File Upload Security:**
   - Handled via `multer.memoryStorage()`.
   - Strict MIME-type filtering: Images restricted to `image/jpeg`, `image/jpg`, `image/png`, `image/webp`.
   - File size caps: 5 MB for profile photos/logos; 15 MB for portfolio documents/certificates.
   - Files stored with sanitized filenames and timestamps via `LocalStorageService`.
6. **Environment Isolation:** Secrets (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, `CORS_ORIGIN`, `UPLOAD_DIR`) isolated in `.env` and excluded via `.gitignore`.

## 13. Skill Assessment & Matching Architecture

### 13.1 Mathematical Match Engine Formulation
Implemented in `backend/src/services/matching.engine.ts`, the composite match calculation evaluates three distinct dimensions:

$$\text{Composite Match Score} = (0.70 \times \text{SkillMatchPct}) + (0.20 \times \text{BranchMatchPct}) + (0.10 \times \text{EligibilityMatchPct})$$

#### 1. Skill Overlap Score ($\text{SkillMatchPct}$, Weight = 70%)
Let:
- $S_i$ = Candidate proficiency in skill $i$ ($0 \le S_i \le 100$)
- $R_i$ = Requisition required proficiency for skill $i$ ($1 \le R_i \le 100$)
- $W_i$ = Importance weight for skill $i$ ($1 \le W_i \le 5$)

$$\text{SkillMatchPct} = \left[ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N \min(S_i, R_i) \times W_i}{\sum_{i=1}^N R_i \times W_i} \right] \times 100$$

#### 2. Academic Branch Alignment ($\text{BranchMatchPct}$, Weight = 20%)
- **$100\%$**: Candidate branch is explicitly listed in `eligibleBranches` (or `eligibleBranches` is empty / "All").
- **$65\%$**: Candidate department matches an eligible department.
- **$30\%$**: Cross-discipline applicant.

#### 3. CGPA & Academic Eligibility ($\text{EligibilityMatchPct}$, Weight = 10%)
- **$100\%$**: Candidate CGPA $\ge \text{minCgpa}$.
- **Penalized**: If $\text{CGPA} < \text{minCgpa}$, $\text{EligibilityMatchPct} = \max\left(0, \left(1 - \frac{\text{minCgpa} - \text{CGPA}}{2}\right) \times 100\right)$, and $\text{isEligible} = \text{false}$.

### 13.2 Deterministic Ranking Algorithm
- Implemented in `backend/src/routes/analytics.routes.ts` (`assignStandardRanks`), the system uses standard competition ranking (1, 1, 3 for ties) based on CGPA for overall, batch, department, and branch rankings.

## 18. Deployment Architecture

### 18.1 Currently Implemented (Local & Staging Monorepo)
- **Monorepo Structure:** npm workspaces linking `@ayush-portal/shared`, `@ayush-portal/backend`, and `@ayush-portal/frontend`.
- **Database:** Local embedded SQLite database (`dev.db`) accessed via Prisma ORM client with automated seeding scripts (`prisma/seed.ts`).
- **File Storage:** Local disk storage in `/uploads` mapped via Express static file middleware.
- **Frontend Dev Server:** Vite development server running on port `5173` proxying `/api` requests to Express on port `5000`.

### 18.2 Planned / Future Production Deployment
*(Marked as planned extensions for cloud deployment)*
- **Database Migration:** Swap SQLite for managed PostgreSQL / MySQL on AWS RDS or Supabase using Prisma schema provider switch (`provider = "postgresql"`).
- **Object Storage:** Swap `LocalStorageService` with AWS S3 / Cloudinary for distributed media and document persistence.
- **Containerization & Hosting:** Docker containers deployed on AWS ECS / DigitalOcean / Vercel with automated CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions.

## 21. SIH Presentation Explanation (60–90 Second Spoken Script)

> *"Good morning, respected jury members. Today, we present **EduBridge**, a comprehensive engineering academia-industry collaboration and placement intelligence platform built specifically for Problem Statement PS 26044.*
>
> *At its core, EduBridge breaks the traditional silos between **Students**, **Faculty**, **Industry**, **Placement Cells**, and **Alumni**.*
>
> *Our architecture is designed as a three-tier reactive system:*
> *First, our **Frontend** delivers five specialized, role-guarded portals built with React 18 and Recharts, providing real-time data visualizations such as the Curriculum Gap Radar and instant skill match breakdowns.*
>
> *Second, our **API and Security Layer** leverages Express with JWT and Zod schema validation, ensuring complete role isolation and secure data handling.*
>
> *Third, our **Core Intelligence Layer** features a deterministic mathematical matching engine. Instead of black-box heuristics, it objectively evaluates candidates on a formula of 70% skill proficiency, 20% academic branch alignment, and 10% CGPA eligibility. This powers bi-directional candidate ranking for recruiters and personalized internship recommendations for students.*
>
> *Finally, our **Persistence Layer** is managed via Prisma ORM, linking everything from MCQ and practical coding submissions to automated ATS resumes, alumni mentorship requests, and 1-click NAAC Criteria 5.2.1 compliance reports.*
>
> *EduBridge transforms engineering education from disconnected learning into a measurable, industry-aligned placement ecosystem. Thank you!"*
